# TedSim
A simulator that simulates the cell division events from the root cell to present-day cells, simultaneously generating the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing lineage barcodes and scRNA-seq data. In particular, TedSim generates cells from multiple cell types through cell division events. TedSim can be used to benchmark and investigate computational methods which use either or both of the two types of data, scRNA-seq and lineage barcodes, to study cell lineages or trajectories.
